<p class="justify">The blending of IoT and cloud technologies is emerging as a top research and development trend. IoT Cloud Systems are constructed by different types of devices and services, which are deployed on multiple IoT and Cloud infrastructure. To managing these systems, we need to perform various types of configuration such as provisioning infrastructures, deploying artifacts, orchestrating the configurations, wiring application components, and reconfiguring the system at runtime. To reduce the efforts of complex management and provide fine-grained configuration features, we develop SALSA, a framework for dynamically configuring IoT Cloud Systems on IoT and multi-cloud infrastructures.</p>

<u>Features:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Configure by multiple stacks: e.g. infrastructure, container/middleware, application, IoT unit.
  <li>Configure by multiple abstraction levels: e.g instance, instance-type, topology, whole system.
  <li>Configure by multiple phases: e.g. deployment time and runtime.
  <li>Configure on multiple clouds: run with both private and public cloud, or a multiple layers of docker platform for simulating cloud environments.
  <li>Configure with rich capabilities: SALSA's default capabilities and external capabilities.
  <li>Ensure configuration dependencies: wire the configurations, maintain the component lifecycle.
</ul>

<u>Usability and performance:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Perform the configuration by distributed and independent agents.
  <li>Orchestrate the agents and configuration processes centrally.
  <li>Collect more capabilities dynamically when external stakeholders involve.
  <li>Communicate via message queue: loose-couple management and error-tolerance.
</ul>

<u>Development:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Opensource
  <li>Pluggable design for extending the configuration mechanisms (e.g. orchestration algorithms, configuration qualities)
  <li>Pluggable design for extending the supported configuration (e.g. cloud systems, artifact types)
</ul>
